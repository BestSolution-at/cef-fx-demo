# cef-fx-demo

This repository contains demo code to see how one can use https://github.com/BestSolution-at/cef-fx

## Running the code

### Windows & Linux

Running the code on those platforms should be straight forward just clone the repo and launch the application.

### MacOSX

Running on OS-X is a bit harder because currently the binaries are not signed. OS-X might refuse to launch them. 
Work to sign the artifacts is on the TODO-List. For now the only option is to allow running unsigned applications.

As we currently only ship x64 binaries you need to have Rosetta-2 installed if you are running on the apple silicon
